# Disinformation and Vaccine Hesitancy
## Fears of Disinformation and COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy among 15 Countries

The COVID-19 pandemic has shown the vitality of reliable communication
channels that allow the 
ow of novel information to the masses. The internet,
particularly social media, was utilized by various institutions in order to con-
nect to people, inform them about the disease, and encourage behaviour that
would help decrease transmissions. This paper hypothesizes that perceptions
of such institutions are critical for the adoption of the behaviour they propose.
Notably, di erent levels of trust in those institutions and the information they
share on social media would correspond to varying levels of adoption of an
encouraged behaviour, such as vaccination. Moreover, trust in di erent types
of institutions might have di erent relationships with vaccine acceptance. By
employing multiple linear regression, this paper explores the signi cance of
distrust in various national and foreign institutions in predicting COVID-19
vaccine hesitancy in a country. The results conclude that the most signi cant
predictor for vaccine hesitancy in a country is trust in foreign governments
and the information they share on social media. The relationship reveals that
in countries where people believe foreign governments and their agents use
social media for disseminating false information more frequently, there are
higher percentages of vaccine hesitant populations. The paper discusses how
this result can be interpreted by highlighting the hegemonic nature of knowl-
edge production during the pandemic. Finally, it calls for action aimed to
restore trust, a factor that proved to be of vital functionality during certain
periods.
